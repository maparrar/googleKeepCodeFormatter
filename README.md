Make backtick wrapped text look like code! {openSource}

An open source extension to make backtick wrapped text look like code in Google Keep.

Any text wrapped in 1 or 3 backticks will be rendered as code (inspired by Markdown syntax).

Use 1 backtick for inline code, and 3 backticks to wrap multi-line code. Note that the 3 backticks MUST be on their own line. If no language is specified, the code will not be syntax highlighted (introduced in version 0.5.0, thanks to @tpantin).

To specify a language, just add the shorthand name of the language like so:

  ```rust


Available languages are:

**********
STANDARD:

bsh
c
cc
cpp
cs
csh
cyc
cv
htm
html
java
js

EXTENDED:

Enjoy!
